    <h2> Ingredient List for Chicken Biryani</h2>
        <p>        

            Chicken — Chicken drumsticks and thighs are ideal for this recipe, as these retain moisture during the slow
            cooking process, resulting in juicy and succulent chicken.

            Rice — Extra long Basmati rice is the most preferred choice for making Chicken Biryani. When cooked, the
            grains stay separate and fluffy and absorb the flavors of the spices and chicken well. Look out for the
            properly aged fragrant basmati rice for best results.

            Ginger and Garlic paste — A fundamental component of most savory dishes, ginger and garlic infuse the dish
            with a depth of flavor. The zesty warmth of ginger combines with the spicy earthiness of the garlic, adding
            an aromatic richness to the marinade.

            Fresh herbs — Cilantro and mint are vital components of this Chicken biryani as they elevate the overall
            taste of the recipe. They add a burst of freshness to the dish and infuse a delightful fragrance while
            balancing the richness of spices and other ingredients.

            <h1> What Ingredients Should I Use</h1>
        <p>
            Rice: I prefer to use aged basmati rice, but regular basmati rice is also appropriate.

            Water: For soaking rice and for cooking the vegetable gravy and rice. You will also need kewra water
            (pandanus extract) or rose water for layering the dish.

            Veggies: Veg biryani can actually be made with just one vegetable or several different kinds of of veggies.
            I like to add a variety of vegetables when making this vegetarian dish. In this recipe, I have added a mix
            of cauliflower, onions, potatoes, carrots, french beans, bell pepper (capsicum), button mushrooms and green
            peas. You can even add aubergines, cabbage, broccoli, spinach and kale in your veg dum biryani.

            Dairy: Ghee or clarified butter, Curd (yogurt) and milk.

            Nuts: Cashews and almonds.

            Seasonings: Cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, tej patta (Indian bay leaf), mace and saffron strands, salt,
            turmeric powder, red chili powder or cayenne pepper or paprika

            Other Ingredients: Shah jeera (caraway seeds), raisins (without seeds), ginger, garlic, chilies, coriander
            leaves or cilantro, mint leaves
